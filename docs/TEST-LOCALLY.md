# Testing Component-Based Architecture Locally

## Quick Test

1. **Start Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open browser and test:**
   - Homepage: http://localhost:5000/
   - About page: http://localhost:5000/about

3. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Header and footer appear on both pages
   - ✅ Homepage shows tools/research search
   - ✅ About page shows mission statement
   - ✅ Both pages share same styling
   - ✅ Navigation links work

## What to Check

- Header is identical on both pages
- Footer is identical on both pages
- Page-specific content loads correctly
- JavaScript functions work (search, modals)
- CSS loads properly

## If Everything Works

You're ready to deploy to Lambda! The same component structure will work on AWS.
